## Requirements Met

You are to implement the following in React:

Use a friendsList.json file to stores all the friends

Ensure your components are reusable

Use TypeScript (type everything typable)

Use React hooks to load up the friends data

Ensure the application is responsive across form factors

Add a language localization switcher with 2 languages on app header

Install a UI component via npm package

Put the code on GitHub and use a proper README file

An app user should be able to favorite a friend and starred friends should persist across page refreshes When the app user clicks on a particular friend, it should display the friend in a friend-details page/view. Feel free to come up with the look and feel of the friend-details page.

Deploy the app online (e.g. to GitHub pages or Netlify), and make sure the project's README or description has a link to the live app.

Integrate Codacy to the repository and attain a code quality rating of B and above

Your app should score 85% and above on all four areas evaluated on https://web.dev/measure (i.e Performance, Best Practices, Accessibility, & SEO)
